place servsaxx.def.sed in etc/ and services_hook.sh in modules/hooks

info:

there are multiple usages, i will give a short description so you can get the gist.

sr means server raw, a raw command to be parsed by the server

	sr->PRIVMSG #maiome.lobby :texttexttext

os means operserv, a module that probably runs in your services package.

	os->restart
	
if you look at servsaxx.def.sed, you will see the different assignments
that you can use here, like:
	cs->register #channel
	ns->logout
	hs->activate person
