shellbot {

shellbot is an IRC bot written in the BASH
scripting language. 

I have not yet written the module guide, nor added
a hook into the code for modules. within the next 
few updates, i will add user-module support with a
guide on how to write, along with an example
module.

Current Module Info:

mod_prowl:

mod_prowl is a module that makes use of the prowl
api to send push notifications to idevices.

default trigger inside the parser is ^push
syntax: ^push <username>

for this to work, you have to add nicknames and
prowl api keys to etc/core_prowl in this format:

nickname-prowl40charAPIkey

if you have it in correct format, when you
send ^push nickname, it will return a code of 200
and tell you how many API calls are remaining.

:end info mod_prowl

mod_trim:

mod_trim is a simple url trimmer, that uses the
is.gd api for shortening and tells you how many
characters the url was shortened. 

the trigger for mod_trim is ^trim.

:end info mod_trim

:config

configuration is in etc/core_config.sh and is
basically self-explanitory. the last option
is your host for the bot to know that youre the 
owner + you can do the advanced commands, etc.

:end info config

:command_list

^shell
^push
^shutdown
^join
^part
^cycle
^uptime
^trim

also responds to CTCP TIME and VERSION.

:end info command_list
